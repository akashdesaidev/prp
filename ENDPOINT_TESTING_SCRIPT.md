## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

### ‚úÖ Success Responses

- **200**: Successful GET/PUT requests
- **201**: Successful POST requests (creation)
- **204**: Successful DELETE requests

### ‚ùå Expected Error Responses

- **400**: Bad request (validation errors)
- **401**: Unauthorized (missing/invalid token)
- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- **404**: Not found (resource doesn't exist)
- **500**: Internal server error

## üèÜ TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Authentication flow works (register/login/refresh)
- [ ] User management (Admin/HR permissions)
- [ ] OKR CRUD operations (role-based permissions)
- [ ] Time tracking (all users can log time)
- [ ] Review cycles (creation and submission)
- [ ] Feedback system (public/private feedback)
- [ ] Analytics (role-based data access)
- [ ] AI services (configuration and usage)
- [ ] Notifications (preferences and delivery)
- [ ] Proper error handling for all scenarios
- [ ] RBAC enforcement (users can't access unauthorized endpoints)

## üîß AUTOMATED TEST SCRIPT

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save this as test_all_endpoints.sh

BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"
TOKEN=""

# Function to test endpoint
test_endpoint() {
    local method=$1
    local endpoint=$2
    local data=$3
    local expected_status=$4

    echo "Testing: $method $endpoint"
    if [ -n "$data" ]; then
        response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X $method "$BASE_URL$endpoint" \
                   -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
                   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                   -d "$data")
    else
        response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X $method "$BASE_URL$endpoint" \
                   -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN")
    fi

    status_code="${response: -3}"
    body="${response%???}"

    if [ "$status_code" = "$expected_status" ]; then
        echo "‚úÖ PASS: $status_code"
    else
        echo "‚ùå FAIL: Expected $expected_status, got $status_code"
        echo "Response: $body"
    fi
    echo "---"
}

# First test health endpoint
test_endpoint "GET" "/health" "" "200"

# Test authentication
echo "Testing authentication..."
# Add more tests here...
```

This comprehensive testing approach will help identify exactly which endpoints are failing and with which user roles.
