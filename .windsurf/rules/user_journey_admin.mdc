# Admin User Journey — Master Specification

**Enterprise-grade, hallucination-proof specification for coding agents**

---

## 🎯 Primary Admin Responsibilities

| Functionality | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Organization Setup | Create departments, teams, reporting structure |
| User Management | Invite users, bulk import via CSV, assign roles, manage reporting chains |
| Review Cycle Management | Create, configure, and monitor performance review cycles |
| OKR Management | Set Company OKRs and manage cascading structure |
| Feedback Oversight | View, moderate, and audit all feedback |
| AI Service Configuration | Manage API keys for OpenAI, Gemini |
| System Settings | Configure environment, security settings, exports, audit |
| Analytics Access | Full access to all dashboards, sentiment, engagement, exports |
| Audit Logs | Full visibility into audit trails for all actions |
| Emergency Controls | Emergency override cycles, data corrections |

---

## 🏗 Admin Setup Flow

### Company Setup Flow

- Admin logs in (OAuth: Google/Microsoft)
- Admin sets up:
  - Company name
  - Organization logo (optional for now)
  - Default timezone, currency, fiscal year settings
- System initializes `organization_id` globally

### Department / Team Setup

- **Create Department**
  - Name (unique under organization)
- **Create Team**
  - Belongs to department (1:1 enforced)
- **Deactivate** allowed (soft-delete pattern applied)

---

## 👥 User Management Flow

### Add Users Individually

- Invite via email
- Assign:
  - Role(s)
  - Department
  - Team
  - Manager (selected via dropdown or email lookup)
- Invite token expires after 7 days

### Bulk CSV Upload

**CSV format:**
```csv
email,first_name,last_name,department,team,role,manager_email
```

**System behavior:**
- Validates CSV pre-import
- Detects conflicts (duplicate email, invalid manager)
- Displays summary report (import success/failures)
- Logs import activity

### Modify Users

- Edit roles, reporting manager, department/team
- Soft-deactivate user (no hard delete)

### Role Assignment

- Multiple roles per user supported (junction table)
- `admin`, `hr`, `manager`, `employee` enum enforced

---

## 📈 OKR Management Flow

- Create Company OKRs → cascading support
- Assign Department → Team → Individual OKRs manually
- `parent_okr_id` drives cascade
- Progress auto-calculates upward but can be manually adjusted if needed
- Editable scoring (1-10 scale)

---

## 🔄 Review Cycle Management

**Create new cycle:**
- Cycle type: quarterly, annual, custom
- Start & end dates
- Minimum 3 days prep buffer
- Review type templates

**Additional features:**
- Clone previous cycle feature supported
- Mid-cycle participant add/remove allowed:
  - Removed users' data retained
- Emergency override: allow up to 2 concurrent cycles per employee

---

## 💬 Feedback Oversight Flow

**View:**
- All feedback — public & private
- Private feedback flagged when viewed

**Moderate:**
- Soft-delete inappropriate feedback (logs reason)

**Skill tags managed freely (user-generated)**

---

## 🤖 AI System Management Flow

**Set API keys for:**
- OpenAI (primary)
- Gemini (fallback)

**Security & monitoring:**
- Keys stored encrypted (AES-256)
- Test API keys on input
- AI error logs accessible:
  - Feature, error type, fallback used, user involved

---

## 📊 Analytics Flow

**Full org-level dashboards:**
- OKR Progress
- Feedback sentiment trends
- Review completion status
- Engagement metrics

**Export:**
- CSV/PDF for any report
- Audit-log of export actions

---

## 📝 Audit Logs

**Permanent record of:**
- User changes
- Review cycles
- OKRs
- Feedback moderation
- Admin system changes

**Features:**
- Fully exportable
- Database partitioning + archival strategy after 2 years

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- All sensitive changes logged
- Role-based access enforced at API level
- OAuth2 login only (no username/password support)
- Full Row Level Security (Supabase RLS enabled)
- Soft-deletes across entire system
- No data deletion allowed

---

## 🚨 Error States

- Overlapping cycles = hard validation failure
- Missing manager = cannot assign cycle
- CSV upload with invalid manager email → error row
- Emergency cycles limited to 2

---

## 🚩 Edge Case Handling

| Edge Case | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| Self as manager | Blocked at validation |
| Department without team | Allowed |
| Team without department | Disallowed |
| Circular reporting | Blocked |
| Duplicate OKR titles | Allowed (titles not unique key) |
| Missing fields on bulk upload | Row skipped, reported |

---

## ⚠️ Developer-Safe Golden Rules

✅ **Critical implementation guidelines:**

- No implicit defaults for reporting chains — always explicit manager assigned
- No auto-creation of OKRs on cascading — only parent linking via `parent_okr_id`
- No deletion of rows — soft-delete everywhere
- All multi-tenancy data segregated with `organization_id` even for single-tenant MVP
- All date/time stored as UTC

---

## 🎯 Admin Flow Priority for Development

| Phase | Features |
|-------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Org setup, user management, CSV imports |
| **Phase 2** | OKR hierarchy, review cycle creation |
| **Phase 3** | Feedback moderation, AI key management |
| **Phase 4** | Analytics, audit logs |

---

## ✅ Specification Status

**This Admin Journey specification is:**
- ✅ Complete and unambiguous
- ✅ Ready for coding agent implementation
- ✅ Enterprise-grade with proper security considerations
- ✅ Includes all edge cases and error handling
- ✅ Zero hallucination zones remaining
