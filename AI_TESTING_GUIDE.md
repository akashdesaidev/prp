## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"AI services temporarily unavailable"**

   - Check if API keys are set correctly
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check API key quotas/billing

2. **"Authentication failed"**

   - Ensure you're logged in with valid JWT token
   - Check token expiration

3. **"Insufficient permissions"**
   - Verify user role has access to AI features
   - Admin/HR roles needed for settings

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check Backend Logs:**

   ```bash
   # Backend logs will show AI service calls
   tail -f backend/logs/app.log
   ```

2. **Test API Keys Manually:**

   ```bash
   # Test OpenAI directly
   curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
   ```

3. **Check Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node -e "console.log('OpenAI:', !!process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY)"
   ```
